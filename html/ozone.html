            <h1>What is Ozone Depletion?</h1> 
            <p>
                Ozone Depletion is the gradual loss of ozone molecules in the upper atmosphere and it is most prevalent in the polar regions. It is caused by bromine and chlorine gasses reaching the stratosphere and ripping apart the ozone molecules. The majority of chlorine and bromine originated from human products such as refrigerators and hairspray. The reason why we need our ozone layer is that it protects us from UV radiation which can harm us in many ways including immune system damage and skin cancer.

            <h1>What caused Ozone Depletion?</h1> 
            <p>
                Ozone depletion was caused by chlorofluorocarbons that ended up in the stratosphere damaging the ozone molecules. The chlorofluorocarbons damaged the ozone because when they got hit by UV radiation they split apart and released chlorine and bromine. Chlorine and bromine then attached themselves to one of the three oxygen atoms in an ozone molecule and ripped it apart resulting in a hole in the ozone layer.

            <h1>What are Chlorofluorocarbons?</h1> 
            <p>
                Chlorofluorocarbons, also known as CFCs, were a widely praised and used invention of the 20th century which were first invented to replace the previously used flammable and toxic gas used in refrigerators but then spread to many other industries like hair spray.

            <h1>What are the effects on Humans?</h1> 
            <p>
                The effects of the increased exposure to UV radiation through ozone depletion can be good and bad. Increased exposure to UV-B radiation increases the production of Vitamin D in our bodies which is very healthy and can help against autoimmune diseases but that is pretty much where the list of health benefits ends. Increased exposure to UV radiation can cause several types of skin cancer and other skin diseases. Research has also shown that increased UV radiation can cause cataracts in some parts of our eyes and can have an effect on our immune systems' ability to fend off diseases. If the hole were to become very large this could impose major implications on human health because our only current solutions to protect against UV radiation are staying in the shade, sunscreen, and sunglasses.

            <h1>What measures have been taken to reverse it?</h1> 
            <p>
                In 1987 the UN introduced the Montreal protocol an agreement that was made to prevent any further damage to the ozone. The Montreal protocol stated that any country in agreement with it must completely ban the use of chlorofluorocarbons. Although only 37 countries agreed to the agreement it was initially proposed all other countries agreed in the following years.

            <h1>What we can learn from this?</h1> 
            <p>
                The fight to protect our planet from chlorofluorocarbons is a great example of a situation where the world came together and won against the greedy industries that are destroying our planet for profit. Many scientists and climate activists dream of an agreement to protect our planet from climate change and the Montreal protocol is a testimony to the possibility of that dream coming true.
